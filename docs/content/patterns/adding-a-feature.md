Adding features is commonly done using some sort of scafolding in tool, in our case we are using [the subgenerators from generator-react-firebase](https://github.com/prescottprue/generator-react-firebase#sub-generators) to add new features.

## React Components

### Top Level

Create a new component name "SomeComponent" by running:

  ```bash
  yo react-firebase:component SomeComponent
  ```

### Nested

Create a new component name "SomeComponent" in `routes/Transaction/routes/Other/components` by running:

  ```bash
  yo react-firebase:component SomeComponent routes/Transaction/routes/Other
  ```

## Cloud Functions

Create a new cloud function "someFunc" by running:

  ```bash
  yo react-firebase:function someFunc
  ```

It creates

  ```txt
  functions/someFunc/index.js
  functions/test/someFunc/index.spec.js
  ```
